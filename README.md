This a patatap clone.  This isn't my original creation, was part of colt steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy [https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

Exercise is a slightly different approach.  Same result.

Sounds are from [https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony)

I'm running through the course to brush up on my skills and to fill in any gaps I have.
